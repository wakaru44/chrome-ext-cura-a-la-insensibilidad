# Setup

I'm not paying the chrome developer fee just for a silly joke. At least not today.

So you will have to install it manually:

- [download](https://github.com/wakaru44/chrome-ext-cura-a-la-insensibilidad/raw/master/packages/chrome-ext-cura-a-la-insensibilidad.zip) the zipfile with the extension from the [packages](https://github.com/wakaru44/chrome-ext-cura-a-la-insensibilidad/raw/master/packages/chrome-ext-cura-a-la-insensibilidad.zip)
- go to "Extensions" in your chrome
- Enable "Developer mode" or "Modo desarrollador" (top right corner of the page)
- Click the button "Add unpacked extension" or "Añadir extesion desempaquetada" and go to that folder.
